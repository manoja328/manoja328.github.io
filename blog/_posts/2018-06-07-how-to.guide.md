If you are wondering how I created this website I will talk about this in this post. Github pages natively support
Jekyll pages. You can find more about this in Github itself. But you are also free to go to [my github repo] i(https://github.com/manoja328/manoja328.github.io) and copy the format I used. 

You’ll find this post in your  `blog/_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and Github will update the site after some time.
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `blog/_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter.

The thing that I like about Jekyll is that it also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

For more info, check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
